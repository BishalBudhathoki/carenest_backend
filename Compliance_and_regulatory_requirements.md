This document outlines the compliance and regulatory requirements for businesses or sole traders generating invoices for NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) clients in Australia.

## 1. Invoice Content Requirements (NDIS-Specific)

All NDIS-related invoices **must include**:

- **Provider Name** – Your legal or trading name
- **ABN** – Australian Business Number (required if registered for GST or earning over $75,000/year)
- **NDIS Participant Name**
- **NDIS Number** – Recommended but not mandatory
- **Invoice Date**
- **Invoice Number** – Unique and sequential
- **Service Description**
- **NDIS Line Item Code** – e.g., `01_011_0107_1_1`
- **Date of Service**
- **Quantity/Duration**
- **Rate (per unit/hour)** – Must comply with current NDIS price limits
- **Total Amount Due**

### 💡 Tip:
Ensure pricing and line items match the official [NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits](https://www.ndis.gov.au/providers/pricing-arrangements).

## 2. GST Considerations

- Most NDIS services are **GST-free** under section 38-38 of the GST Act.
- If you earn over **$75,000/year**, **you must register for GST**.
- If GST applies, your invoice must clearly show:
  - **GST amount**
  - A note such as:
  
    > *"This service is GST-free under subsection 38-38 of the GST Act."*

---

## 3. Record-Keeping Requirements

You must retain the following for **at least 5 years**:

- Copies of invoices
- Proof of service delivery (e.g., timesheets, service agreements, communication logs)
- Payment records

This is important for both:
- ATO audits
- NDIS participant funding reviews

## 4. Payment & Submission Rules

Depending on the participant's plan management type:

| Plan Type         | Who You Invoice                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Self-managed**  | Participant directly                     |
| **Plan-managed**  | The participant's Plan Manager           |
| **NDIA-managed**  | **Only available to registered providers**, via the myplace portal |

Include payment terms clearly, such as:

> **Payment Terms**: Due within 7 days of invoice date.

---

## 5. Rules for Registered NDIS Providers

If you are a **registered NDIS provider**, you are subject to:

- **NDIS Practice Standards**
- Mandatory **Service Agreements** with each client
- Internal quality assurance and complaint management systems

Unregistered providers can work with:
- **Plan-managed participants**
- **Self-managed participants**

They **cannot** work with **NDIA-managed participants**.
